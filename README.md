# 🎯 Guess It Right!

Welcome to **Guess It Right!** – a fun little Python project where you try to guess a number the computer randomly picks between 1 and 100. It's a battle of brains and luck! 🤓🍀

## 🚀 Features

- Random number generation from 1 to 100 🎲
- Two difficulty modes:
  - **Easy** (10 attempts)
  - **Hard** (5 attempts)
- Feedback on whether your guess is too high or too low 📉📈
- Fun ASCII art logo on startup 🎨

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Run the script using any Python 3 interpreter.
2. Choose your difficulty level: Easy or Hard.
3. Start guessing the number!
4. Win by guessing the number before you run out of attempts. Lose and the computer mocks your pain 😈 (gently).

## 🧠 Sample Output
